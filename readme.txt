Capture, manage and reply to feedback from your customers.

== Description ==

Ever notice how disambiguated information becomes when several employees try to manage customer feedback from their inbox? [LoopTodo](http://www.loopto.do) solves this problem by keeping customer communications and feedback organized on a feedback card inside your Loop. 

Reply to feedback directly from your Loop. Communications with customers are documented on the feedback card so all of your staff members are kept in the loop. Mark internal messages and notes as "private" so they remain visible only to your organization.

Embed the feedback button on your website or web application to give your customers an easy way to leave feedback, suggestions, report bugs, or give other types of feedback. 

LoopTodo uses a "do now" or "do later" approach to tasks created from feedback. Things that are most important are pushed to the front while things that can wait are safely tucked away for a later time. Annotate tasks with internal messages to update their progress and report status updates to others shared on the loop.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `LoopTodo-Feedback.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click "Settings" then "LoopTodo" and follow instructions on the LoopTodo Plugin Settings page.

Basically, in the LoopTodo settings page, you'll be asked to create an account and login to the [LoopTodo Web Application](http://my.loopto.do) and retrieve the "Loop key" for the feedback loop, which represents where your customer feedback will be managed from. The process is pretty simple and straightforward:  Copy the Loop Key from [http://my.loopto.do](http://my.loopto.do) to the LoopTodo Plugin Settings page, and click "Save Changes".

Afterwards, load your Wordpress site in your web browser to verify that the "Feedback and Support" button appears. If you do have trouble, email us at info@loopto.do with any questions you may have.
